Hello, My name is Garland Berenzy;

I work in the film industry as a lighting technician;

I'm learning how to program to create 
more software for the film industry;

The production side of film
currently has very little software support;

With some well designed xplatform web applications
we could eliminate a lot of menial tasks and
redundancies in communication,
speeding up the operations process of making
films, commercials and television shows.
